            "Emotions are immediate brain responses, and we cannot choose them. When do emotions become destructive? Science says that all emotions are normal, but they become destructive when not expressed properly. According to Gross and Hooria Jazairi (2014), the inability to control emotions is the root of psychological disorders such as depression and other personality disorders. Knowing your emotional triggers can help avoid problems early on. By practicing, you can turn negative things into positive ones and indirectly gain emotional satisfaction. Here are five approach steps that can be adjusted to situations that may cause problems: Choosing situations. Avoid situations that may trigger emotions, especially unwanted ones. For instance, if you know you'll likely get angry when in a hurry, leave home or somewhere earlier to avoid getting angry or feeling rushed. Modifying situations. Try to reduce disappointment. For example, if you hope to organize a perfect birthday event for a friend or family but things keep going wrong for you, shift your focus. Redirect your attention. If you constantly feel down with the people around you, try shifting your focus from them to yourself or other things. This way, you can feel more confident in your abilities. Enjoy your own process so you feel proud of yourself. Changing thoughts. The core of our deepest emotions is a belief that drives them. You feel sad when you believe you have lost something, angry when you decide that your goals have failed. You may not be able to change the situation, but you can change your thoughts. Replace thoughts that lead to sadness or unhappiness with thoughts that lead to joy. Changing responses. If the above approaches do not work in controlling your emotions, the last step is to control your responses. Your heart might race due to unpleasant sensations when feeling anxious or angry. Try taking deep breaths and closing your eyes to calm yourself."

Research shows that habits can form in just 18 days or take up to six months. However, once good habits are established, maintaining them becomes easier. Here are some good habits to improve your mental health: get enough sleep, stay active, eat a balanced diet, practice gratitude, connect with others, practice mindfulness, set realistic goals, learn to say no, rest, and talk to someone."
