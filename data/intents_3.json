		"responses": ["Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."]

Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone."

When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself.

Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression."

However, as it intensifies, mood disturbances become harder to avoid. Common symptoms of depression include: Feeling sad, gloomy, empty, hopeless, and anxious. Easily losing energy and feeling fatigued, weak, and exhausted. Sleep disturbances (which can be excessive or insufficient). Loss of interest and enthusiasm for previously enjoyed activities. Feelings of guilt, pessimism, and worthlessness. Difficulty concentrating. Thoughts of self-harm or suicide."

			"Emotions are immediate brain responses, and we cannot choose them. When do emotions become destructive? Science says that all emotions are normal, but they become destructive when not expressed properly. According to Gross and Hooria Jazairi (2014), the inability to control emotions is the root of psychological disorders such as depression and other personality disorders. Knowing your emotional triggers can help avoid problems early on. By practicing, you can turn negative things into positive ones and indirectly gain emotional satisfaction. Here are five approach steps that can be adjusted to situations that may cause problems: Choosing situations. Avoid situations that may trigger emotions, especially unwanted ones. For instance, if you know you'll likely get angry when in a hurry, leave home or somewhere earlier to avoid getting angry or feeling rushed. Modifying situations. Try to reduce disappointment. For example, if you hope to organize a perfect birthday event for a friend or family but things keep going wrong for you, shift your focus. Redirect your attention. If you constantly feel down with the people around you, try shifting your focus from them to yourself or other things. This way, you can feel more confident in your abilities. Enjoy your own process so you feel proud of yourself. Changing thoughts. The core of our deepest emotions is a belief that drives them. You feel sad when you believe you have lost something, angry when you decide that your goals have failed. You may not be able to change the situation, but you can change your thoughts. Replace thoughts that lead to sadness or unhappiness with thoughts that lead to joy. Changing responses. If the above approaches do not work in controlling your emotions, the last step is to control your responses. Your heart might race due to unpleasant sensations when feeling anxious or angry. Try taking deep breaths and closing your eyes to calm yourself."

It’s easy to fall into unhealthy patterns (e.g., too much junk food, lack of sleep), but with a few simple adjustments to your routine, you can build good habits that help address mental health issues. Research shows that habits can form in just 18 days or take up to six months. However, once good habits are established, maintaining them becomes easier. Here are some good habits to improve your mental health: get enough sleep, stay active, eat a balanced diet, practice gratitude, connect with others, practice mindfulness, set realistic goals, learn to say no, rest, and talk to someone."
